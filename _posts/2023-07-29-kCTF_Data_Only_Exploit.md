## Introduction
I've been doing some Linux kernel exploit development/study and vulnerability research off and on since last Fall and a few months ago I had some downtime on vacation to sit and challenge myself to write my first data-only exploit for a real bug that was exploited in kCTF. `io_ring` has been a popular target in the program's history up to this point, so I thought I'd find an easy-to-reason-about bug there that had already been exploited as fertile ground for exploit development creativity. The bug I chose to work with was one which resulted in a `struct file` UAF where it was possible to hold an open file descriptor to the freed object. There have been quite a few write-ups on `file` UAF exploits, so I decided as a challenge that my exploit had to be data-only. The parameters of the self-imposed challenge were completely arbitrary, but I just wanted to try writing an exploit that didn't rely on hijacking control flow. I have written quite a few Linux kernel exploits of real kCTF bugs at this point, probably 5-6 as practice, just starting with the vulnerability and going from there, but all of them have ended up in me using ROP, so this was my first try at data-only. I also had not seen a data-only exploit for a `struct file` UAF yet, which was encouraging as it seemed it was worthwile "research".

## The Bug
The [bug](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=fc7222c3a9f56271fba02aabbfbae999042f1679) is extremely simple (why can't I find one like this?) and was exploited in [kCTF](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vS1REdTA29OJftst8xN5B5x8iIUcxuK6bXdzF8G1UXCmRtoNsoQ9MbebdRdFnj6qZ0Yd7LwQfvYC2oF/pubhtml#) in November of last year.
