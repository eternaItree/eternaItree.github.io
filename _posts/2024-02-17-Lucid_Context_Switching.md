## Introduction
If you haven't heard, we're developing a fuzzer on the blog these days. I don't even know if "fuzzer" is the right word for what we're building, it's almost more like an execution engine that will expose hooks? Anyways, if you missed the first episode you can catch up [here](https://h0mbre.github.io/New_Fuzzer_Project/).
